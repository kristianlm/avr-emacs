troubleshooting
===============

### send.f hangs

make sure your serial is set up ok:

    for i in {{ 0 100 }} ; do echo test $i ; done > testlines
    ./send.f /dev/ttyUSB0 testlines

### flashing ok, but any colon-definition freezes the controller

maybe the fuse bits are wrong. you need to set them so there's a big
bootloader. see make fuse.

### serial port drops characters randomly

are you sure only one program is using it? try

    sudo lsof | grep /dev/ttyACM0 # or your equivalent

-- krüe
